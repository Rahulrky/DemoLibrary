Sure! Here is a low-level flow for the PoC incorporating GPT-3.5-turbo for regulation data extraction and update:

1. Crawling Web for Regulations:
   - Identify relevant websites or sources.
   - Implement a web crawler or scraper to collect data from these sources.
   - Store the crawled data for further processing.

2. Data Preprocessing:
   - Remove HTML tags and irrelevant information from the crawled data.
   - Clean and normalize the text, removing special characters, extra spaces, and punctuation.
   - Standardize the data format, ensuring consistency.

3. Regulation Data Extraction using GPT-3.5-turbo:
   - Define a prompt or query format for GPT-3.5-turbo based on the desired regulation data to extract.
   - Prepare the preprocessed text as the input for the GPT-3.5-turbo model.
   - Make an API call to the GPT-3.5-turbo model, passing the input text as a prompt.
   - Retrieve the generated response from the model.
   - Extract the relevant regulation data from the model's response based on the defined format or patterns.

4. Repository Management:
   - Check if the extracted data contains a new regulation or amendments.
   - If it is a new regulation:
     - Add the regulation data to the repository, including the title, content, date, and any other relevant information.
   - If it contains amendments:
     - Identify the old regulation from the repository based on matching criteria (e.g., regulation title or identifier).
     - Update the old regulation in the repository with the extracted amendments.
     - Maintain a history or versioning mechanism to track changes.

5. Iterate and Improve:
   - Continuously monitor and crawl the web for new regulations or amendments.
   - Periodically evaluate the performance of GPT-3.5-turbo in data extraction.
   - Collect user feedback to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of the extraction process.
   - Fine-tune the prompt/query format for GPT-3.5-turbo based on the feedback received.
   - Refine the preprocessing steps to handle different data variations and improve the quality of input for the model.

This low-level flow outlines the step-by-step process of crawling, preprocessing, extracting regulation data using GPT-3.5-turbo, and managing the repository for new regulations and amendments. It provides a detailed guide for implementing the PoC and can be further expanded and refined based on specific requirements and technical considerations.
