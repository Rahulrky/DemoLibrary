How are mismatch errors resolved step-by-step?

Please share the error report for PSA and FCA.

Share the document or SOP used to mitigate the mismatch error.

In light of your past experiences, please share the top mismatch scenarios and the top actions taken in each case.

What are the attributes/parameters involved in determining the mitigating action identified?

Do we maintain a history of the steps taken to resolve the error?

Are future mismatches subject to the same action as past mismatches? In order to resolve a mismatch, does every time step needs to be unique?

Is it useful to refer to and resolve fresh mismatches based on historical data prepared with specific attributes?
