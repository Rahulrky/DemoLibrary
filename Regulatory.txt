Here's a brief description of each point in the task plan:

Phase 1: Project Planning and Requirements

1. Define project scope and requirements: Establish the goals, objectives, and boundaries of the project, including the target audience, desired outcomes, and any constraints.

2. Identify compliance-related data points and criteria: Determine the specific data points and criteria that the application should focus on when searching for compliance-related information in the documents.

3. Gather sample documents for testing and validation: Collect a set of sample documents that represent the types of documents the application will process, to be used for testing and validation purposes.

Phase 2: GPT-3.5-turbo Integration and Query Development

4. Set up GPT-3.5-turbo API integration: Configure the necessary tools, libraries, and resources required for integrating the GPT-3.5-turbo API into the application.

5. Develop a query generation strategy for compliance-related data extraction: Design a method for generating queries based on the extracted text from the documents that will effectively retrieve compliance-related data from GPT-3.5-turbo.

6. Test and refine queries for accuracy and relevance: Test the generated queries with GPT-3.5-turbo and refine them as needed to ensure they return accurate and relevant compliance-related data.

Phase 3: Document Processing and Data Extraction

7. Implement document submission and preprocessing for user input: Develop a system for users to submit documents and preprocess the input to make it suitable for querying GPT-3.5-turbo.

8. Extract relevant text from the document for GPT-3.5-turbo processing: Parse the submitted documents to extract the text that will be used for generating queries to GPT-3.5-turbo.

9. Send queries to GPT-3.5-turbo and process the responses: Submit the generated queries to GPT-3.5-turbo and handle the responses to extract compliance-related data.

Phase 4: Compliance Data Processing and Presentation

10. Extract and process compliance-related data from GPT-3.5-turbo responses: Parse the GPT-3.5-turbo responses to extract relevant compliance-related data and process it for presentation to the user.

11. Implement data validation and error handling: Ensure the application can handle invalid inputs and unexpected situations gracefully, and validate the extracted compliance data.

12. Design and develop a user interface to display compliance data: Create a user interface that presents the extracted compliance-related data in an organized and easily understandable format.

Phase 5: Testing and Optimization

13. Test the application with various document types and scenarios: Validate the application's functionality and robustness by testing it with a range of document types and compliance scenarios.

14. Optimize the application based on testing feedback and performance metrics: Refine the application based on test results and performance data to improve its efficiency and effectiveness.

Phase 6: Documentation and Deployment

15. Develop documentation and user guides: Create comprehensive documentation and user guides to help users understand and use the application effectively.

16. Plan and execute a deployment strategy: Develop a plan for deploying the application to the target environment and execute the plan.

Phase 7: Maintenance and Support

17. Set up a maintenance and update schedule for the application: Establish a schedule for maintaining and updating the application to ensure its continued effectiveness and relevance.

18. Establish a user support and feedback system: Implement a system for users to report issues, provide feedback, and receive assistance with the application.
