Subject: Request for Exception to Work from the Office

Dear [Supervisor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss a matter that requires your understanding and support. Due to my mother's ongoing health condition, I would like to request an exception to work from the office.

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, my mother underwent a major surgery. Unfortunately, her recovery has been slow, and she currently requires assistance to walk. As her primary caregiver, it is crucial for me to be available to support and care for her during this challenging period.

I kindly request permission to work from home until my mother's condition improves. I want to assure you that I will maintain my productivity and fulfill all my responsibilities remotely, as I have done successfully in the past.

While I understand that remote work is not the usual practice within our organization, I am sincerely grateful for your understanding and flexibility in this matter. If needed, I am more than willing to provide any necessary documentation or medical certificates to support my request.

Thank you for your consideration and support. I look forward to discussing this further with you to find a suitable solution that ensures both my responsibilities at work and my ability to provide care for my mother.

Best regards,
