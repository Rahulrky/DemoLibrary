      "Annex 9:  PROVISIONS RELATING TO PARKING BRAKING SYSTEMS EQUIPPED WITH A MECHANICAL BRAKE-CYLINDER LOCKING DEVICE (Lock actuators) 1.  DEFINITION \"Mechanical brake-cylinder locking device\" means a device which ensures braking operation of the parking braking system by mechanically locking the brake piston rod. Mechanical locking is effected by exhausting the compressed fluid held in the locking chamber; it is so designed that unlocking can be effected by restoring pressure in the locking chamber.  2.  SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS  2.1. When the pressure in the locking chamber approaches the level at which mechanical locking occurs, an optical or audible warning device shall come into action. Provided this requirement is met, the warning device may comprise the red warning signal specified in paragraph 5.2.1.29.1.1. of this Regulation. This provision shall not apply to trailers. In the case of trailers, the pressure corresponding to mechanical locking shall not exceed 400 kPa. It shall be possible to achieve parking braking performance after any single failure of the trailer service braking system. In addition, it shall be possible to release the brakes at least three times after the trailer has been uncoupled, the pressure in the supply line being 650 kPa before the uncoupling. These conditions shall be satisfied when the brakes are adjusted as closely as possible. It shall also be possible to apply and release the parking braking system as specified in paragraph 5.2.2.10. of this Regulation when the trailer is coupled to the towing vehicle. 2.2. In cylinders equipped with a mechanical locking device, movement of the brake piston shall be ensured by energy from either of two independent energy storage devices. 2.3. It shall not be possible to release the locked brake cylinder unless it is certain that after such release the brake can be applied again. 2.4. In the event of a failure of the energy source feeding the locking chamber, an auxiliary release device (e.g. mechanical, or pneumatic which may use the air contained in one of the vehicle's tyres) shall be available. 2.5. The control shall be such that, when actuated, it performs the following operations in sequence: it applies the brakes so as to provide the degree of efficiency required for parking braking, locks the brakes in that position and then cancels out the brake application force.  \f",
